# The tests require 2 docker hosts. This is accomplished by using Vagrant to
# create a VM with docker installed. The macos-12 runner is used because it
# supports nested virtualization. However, erlef/setup-beam@v1 does not support
# macos-12, so we create 2 VMs. One to run the elixir tests and one to run the
# extra docker host.
